[Read our Planning Document with more details about how Exposure Notifications work](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin.exposurenotification/blob/master/Exposure%20Notification%20Planning.pdf)

Apple and Google are both creating APIâ€™s for a compatible BLE based Contact Tracing implementation which relies heavily on generating and storing rolling unique identifiers on a device, which are broadcast to nearby devices.  Devices which detect nearby identifiers then store these identifiers as they come into range (or contact) with for up to 14 days.

When a person has confirmed a diagnosis, they tell their device which then submits the locally stored, self-generated rolling unique identifiers from the last 14 days to a back end service provided by the app implementing the API.

Devices continually request the keys submitted by diagnosed people from the backend server.  The device then compares these keys to the unique identifiers of other devices it has been near in the last 14 days.

## Xamarin.ExposureNotification

This project contains the cross platform wrapper API around the native Android and iOS API's.  The sample app uses this library to implement the exposure notification code one time for both platforms.

### Bindings to Native APIs _(NuGet)_

We also have NuGet packages available with bindings to the native Android and iOS Exposure Notifaction API's

 - iOS: [Xamarin.iOS.ExposureNotification](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.iOS.ExposureNotification/) (Requires XCode 11.5 beta1 or newer)
 - Android: [Xamarin.GooglePlayServices.Nearby.ExposureNotification](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.GooglePlayServices.Nearby.ExposureNotification/)


# Sample

Tere is a sample implementation of the mobile app and backend.

## Mobile App

A sample mobile app to use the API.

## Server

A sample backend to handle diagnosis submissions.

## Requirements

The server requires a few things:

* **Azure Functions**  
  This is the core processing logic.
* **Blob Storage**  
  This is to store the signed batch files.
* **SQL Server**  
  This is to store the temporary keys until they are batched.
* **KeyVault** _(optional)_  
  This can be used to store any secrets to keep them out of the portal.

## Functions

App functions:

* `/api/selfdiagnosis`  
  Submit a diagnosis from the app.

Management functions:

* `/api/manage/start-batch`  
  Start the batch job on demand. _The `CreateBatchesTimed` job does run periodically._
* `/api/manage/diagnosis-uids`  
  Add/remove diagnosis UIDs from the health provider.
* `CreateBatchesTimed`  
  A timed job that runs every 6 hours to create batch files.

Development functions:

* `/api/dev/dummy-keys`  
  A development-only function to populate the database with fake self-diagnosis submissions.
